# Dendroptimized

Optimized C++ algorithms for dendromatics. 
It relies on Eigen library for matrix and vector handling, and Taskflow for parallel primitives.

Available algorithms:

 - C++ voxelization
 
To be added in a near future
 - C++ Parallel DBSCAN with voxelization prior
 - C++ Feature computation (A la jakteristics) (with nanoflann as NN library. this feature is already implemented but should be included in PGEOF)
